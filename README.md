## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a spatial analysis project aimed at identifying uninhabitable regions in South Island, New Zealand. The project uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and open-source data to map areas unsuitable for habitation based on elevation, slope, forest density, and road accessibility.

## Motivation
With the increasing demand for land and infrastructure development in South Island, it is crucial to identify regions where development is either impractical or could be detrimental to the environment. This project aids in making informed decisions for sustainable land use and infrastructure planning.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes several open-source datasets:
- **SRTM Digital Elevation Model:** For elevation and slope data.
- **Road Section Geometry:** From Land Information New Zealand, for road accessibility data.
- **MODIS Land Cover Dataset:** Accessed via Google Earth Engine, for forest density data.
